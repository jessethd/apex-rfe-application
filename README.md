# APEX Request-For-Exception Application
CS347 Data Management final project, in which we created a "Request For Exception" database in Oracle SQL and corresponding web application (using Oracle Application Express). Web application allows for the creation of RFEs and facilitates their traversal up the chain of approval. Administrators can perform various administrative actions and approve, reject, or return RFEs at their administrative level. Comments may be submitted on RFEs and are automatically added for many status changing actions.

Notes about using web application:

All three models can be viewed. Samples of much of the SQL logic used in the web application can be found in sql_samples.sql, and the sample data currently loaded into the web application database can be viewed in the data folder.
